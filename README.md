# hebrewTransliteration
An app that transliterates Hebrew text according to SBL guidlines for academic transliteration.

# How to Use
Copy and paste any unicode Hebrew text into the input field and press submit. A transliterated text will appear below.

For example:
Copy the text below:

>וְהָאָרֶץ הָיְתָה תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ וְחֹשֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵי תְהֹום וְרוּחַ אֱלֹהִים מְרַחֶפֶת עַל־פְּנֵי הַמָּֽיִם׃

This will produce the text below:

><i>wǝhāʾāreṣ hāyǝtâ tōhû wābōhû wǝḥōšek ʿal-pǝnê tǝhôm wǝrûaḥ ʾĕlōhîm mǝraḥepet ʿal-pǝnê hammāyim</i>

This <i>transliterates</i> the text; it does not translate it.

# Known Issues

1. Short vowels written with a mater only appear with a circumflex
2. Defectively written long vowels only appear as short-vowels
3. Qamats Qatan only transliterates correctly when is a closed syllable as indicated by a BeGaDKePaT letter
